Donna's opinion with writing my own grid versus using Bootstrap:
  I prefer Bootstrap. For starters, installing was a snap using CDN compared to downloading and running css. Then, all I did was copy and paste the link and scripts from http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/download/ to our pages. When creating multiple grids, you can use shortcuts/repeat to where you want your grids.

For Jose, at first I thought that creating the grid using css was much easier and cleaner. Bootstrap seemed overbearing at the beginning.
When I first started to research how to use bootstrap it seemed overbearing and confusing.
However, when I started looking at the example files bootstrap provided it started coming together.
Once I started tinkering with the templates it started making sense.
Our end result about page turned out to be much cleaner/ easier to view than out index.html page.
