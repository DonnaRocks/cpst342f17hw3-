Donna's opinion with writing my own grid versus using Bootstrap:
  I prefer Bootstrap. For starters, installing was a snap using CDN compared to downloading and running css. Then, all I did was copy and paste the link and scripts from http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/download/ to our pages. When creating multiple grids, you can use shortcuts/repeat to where you want your grids.
