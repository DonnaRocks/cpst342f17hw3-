### Ojective 3 - Donna's Feedback
Donna's opinion with writing my own grid versus using Bootstrap:
  I prefer Bootstrap. For starters, installing was a snap using CDN compared to downloading and running css. Then, all I did was copy and paste the link and scripts from http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/download/ to our pages. When creating multiple grids, you can use shortcuts/repeat to where you want your grids.


### Objective 3 - Jose's Feedback
Understanding using the grid's was a little more difficult that I expected, either way. 
Understanding the grid structure was not that difficult, but implementing it in HTML and CSS was puzzling. 

I found a great resource that explained how to create the grid layout in CSS. It was very clear and straightforward and became very easy to use.
I was able to wrap my head around creating the website and grid in this way. 
The code was very clean and easy to wrap my head around. 
However, the end-result website looks very barebones. 

On the other hand, bootstrap seemed overbearing at the beginning.
When I first started to research how to use bootstrap it seemed extremely confusing.
However, when I started looking at the example files bootstrap provided it started coming together.
Once I started tinkering with the templates it started making sense.
Our end result about.html page turned out to be much cleaner/ easier on the eyes than out index.html page.
