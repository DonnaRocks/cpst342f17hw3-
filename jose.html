<h1>Jose De La Espriella</h1>
<p>I am a senior at Loyola University. I am finishing a Bachelors degree in both Management and Information Technology.
    I am aiming to graduate by May 2018. My original background is in Computer Science, but I ended up not liking it much.
    As I grew older, I decided to start moving away from computer science and into Management. But figured I should complete the IT degree as well.

    I am a huge tech-fan. The type that will be up early enough to preorder a new phone (this year included.)
    I also <b><i>love</i></b> cars. Attached is a picture of some of the cars in my family. We have 5 total. It's an expensive hobby.
    But considering it's something that I use everyday, I think its a worthwhile investment. All of the cars in my family are manual transmission.

<p> I also love my two baby girls - Hazel and Winsey. Hazel is 5 years old, Winsey is 2 years old. Winsey however, is the larger of the two.
    First picture is when Winsey was 2 weeks old, followed by a recent picture.
